Missing Data Handling:
-Wet Bulb Temperature: 75975 missing vales(38.69%)
Method: Dropped 

-Rain Intensity: 75975 missing vales(38.69%)
Method: Dropped

-Total Rain: 75975 missing vales(38.69%)
Method: Dropped

-Heading: 75975 missing vales(38.69%)
Method: Dropped

-Precipitation Type: 75975 missing vales(38.69%)
Method: Dropped

Why? 38.67% of the missing data were dropped because I was not able to apply KNN-Imputation. My cell kept crashing.The missing data were
correlated across variables, suggesting a MNAR mechanism.Since applying simple imputation to these values could introduce
bias into the analysis, I chose to drop the missing observations. 

- Barometric Pressure: 146 missing values (0.07%)
  Method: Median (appropriate for skwed data)
  Result: All missing values filled

  - Air Temperature: 75 missing values (0.04%)
  Method: Forward-fill (time series appropriate)
  Result: All missing values filled
