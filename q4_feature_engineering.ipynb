See **Lecture 09** for time series rolling window operations. For hourly data, common window sizes are 7-24 hours (capturing daily patterns). Use pandas `rolling()` method with `window` parameter to specify the number of periods.\n",

    "You must create exactly these 3 files in the `output/` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `output/q4_features.csv`\n",
    "**Format:** CSV file\n",
    "**Content:** Dataset with all derived features added\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- All original columns from Q3\n",
    "- All new derived features added as columns\n",
    "- **No index column** (save with `index=False`)\n",

    "**Format:** CSV file\n",
    "**Content:** Dataset with rolling window features\n",
    "**Required Columns:**\n",
    "- Original datetime column\n",
    "- At least one rolling window calculation column (e.g., `water_temp_rolling_7h`, `air_temp_rolling_24h`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Must include at least one rolling window calculation\n",

    "- [ ] Derived features created (differences, ratios, interactions, etc.)\n",
    "- [ ] Time-based aggregations performed (by hour, day, month, etc.) - optional but recommended\n",
    "- [ ] At least one rolling window calculation (rolling mean, rolling median, etc.)\n",
    "- [ ] Categorical features created (if applicable)\n",

    "## Your Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create derived features** - Differences, ratios, interactions between variables (watch for division by zero)\n",
    "2. **Calculate rolling windows** - Use `.rolling()` on predictor variables to capture temporal patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "   ⚠️ **Data Leakage Warning:** Do not create ANY features that use your target variable - this includes rolling windows, differences, ratios, or interactions involving the target. For example, if predicting Air Temperature, do not create `air_temp * humidity` or `air_temp - wet_bulb`. Only derive features from other predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create categorical features** - Bin continuous variables if useful (optional)\n",
    "4. **Check for infinity values** - Ratios can produce infinity; replace with NaN and handle appropriately\n",
    "5. **Document and save** - Remember to `reset_index()` before saving CSVs\n",

    "- **Derived features:** What relationships might be useful? Temperature differences? Ratios? Interactions between variables?\n",
    "- **Rolling windows:** What window size makes sense? 7 hours? 24 hours? Consider the temporal scale of your data. For hourly data, 7-24 hours captures daily patterns.\n",
    "- **Time-based aggregations:** Aggregate by hour? Day? Week? What temporal granularity is useful for your analysis?\n",
